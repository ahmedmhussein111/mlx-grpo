# MLX-GRPO: Train Your Own DeepSeek-R1 Style Reasoning Model on Mac üß†

Welcome to the MLX-GRPO repository! This project allows you to train your own DeepSeek-R1 style reasoning model on Apple Silicon. This is the first MLX implementation of GRPO, the innovative technique behind R1's o1-matching performance. With MLX-GRPO, you can build a mathematical reasoning AI without the need for expensive Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF).

## Introduction

The MLX-GRPO project focuses on enabling users to develop reasoning models that can perform multi-step reasoning tasks. By leveraging the GRPO technique, you can create systems that think through problems like a human would. This is particularly useful in applications such as mathematical reasoning, decision-making, and more.

### What is GRPO?

GRPO stands for Generalized Reasoning and Problem Optimization. It is a breakthrough technique that allows models to optimize their reasoning paths, leading to better performance in tasks requiring complex thought processes. This implementation is specifically optimized for Apple Silicon, ensuring high performance and efficiency.

## Features

- **Apple Silicon Optimized**: The model runs efficiently on Mac devices with Apple Silicon.
- **No Expensive RLHF**: Build powerful reasoning models without the high costs associated with traditional reinforcement learning methods.
- **Multi-Step Reasoning**: Capable of handling complex reasoning tasks that require multiple steps to arrive at a solution.
- **Easy Installation**: Simple setup process to get you started quickly.
- **Open Source**: Contribute to the project and help improve the model.

## Usage

Once you have installed the project, you can start using it to train your own reasoning models. Here‚Äôs a quick guide on how to get started:

1. **Prepare Your Dataset**: 
   Ensure your dataset is formatted correctly for the model. The dataset should contain examples of reasoning tasks and their corresponding solutions.

2. **Configure the Model**: 
   Edit the configuration file to set parameters like learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.

3. **Train the Model**:
   Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python train.py --config config.yaml
   ```

4. **Evaluate the Model**:
   After training, you can evaluate the model‚Äôs performance using:
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py --model your_model_path
   ```

5. **Use the Model for Inference**:
   Once you are satisfied with the model‚Äôs performance, you can use it to make predictions on new data.
